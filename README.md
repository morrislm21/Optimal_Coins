# Optimal-Coins
 A C++ program that is used to find the optimal coins for an amount when given certain denominations of coins. This program uses a matrix header file provided by Dr. Jon Beck of Truman State University. This program uses that matrix to find the possible combinations of coins that a person could use to make the amount. Then, that matrix is passed to a recursive optimization function which finds the minimal number of coins to reach the amount. Then a traceback function is called to print out the optimal matrix formed from the optimization function. An application of this program could be for cashiers to use it to quickly find the minimal amount of coins needed for giving a customer change.
